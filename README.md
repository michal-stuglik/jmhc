# jMHC

The software is used for analyzing and visualization of the results of deep amplicon sequencing, as currently performed using 454 and Illumina technology, but as the software operates on FASTA files, output from any technology can be used in principle. We developed this software for genotyping of major histocompatibility complex but we can imagine that it may be useful for analyzing amplicons derived from other multigene families or for genotyping other polymorphic systems.
