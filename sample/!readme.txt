Files sample_data_01.fna and sample_data_02.fna contain a number of sequences derived from MHC class II exon 2 amplicons of several species.
Amplification primers for one of them were:
F: GAGTGTCRTTTYTACAAYGGGAC
R: TGCWCAGTGAAGCYMTC
Both F and R primers were tagged with 6 bp tags
amplicons_tags.txt - tags and multifasta files corresponding to five selected individuals 
known_alleles.fas - MHC class II exon 2 alleles already known for the species
